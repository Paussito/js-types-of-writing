//In JavaScript there are diferent forms of naming Vars:
//In this file we'll see the "CAMEL CASE"

//------------//

// Example: //

let camelCase = 1
let camelCaseLooksGood = 2

//The most I like is this, camelCase, the structure is very simple, if you want
//to separate words you put the first letter in Capital letter
